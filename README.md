# Class Overview for Chance & Choice

## STUDIO B week 6

### Task 2: An Image That Can Change (Drawing with Code)
You will then get you to introduce them to the second task. For this task they will be drawing a simple visual symbol with code and getting that symbol to change in response to a mouse click. See the brief for this task here https://uts-visual-communication.github.io/chance-and-choice/

#### part 1 - run through p5.js drawing & color
1. A base file for them to build off is also available in the download from the site, see 'base-file-no-comments' and 'base-file'.
2. Get them to open base-file's index.html in the browser. When they click the shape will change.
3. Then get them to open the sketch.js file in the editor. In this file I have all different drawing commands commented out. First of all get them to uncomment point. Save the file, refresh it in the browser.
4. Explain how they the two parameters in the brackets tell P5 where to draw the point on screen. Explaining how the co-ordinate system works. See the 'point' example here for a visual you can use. https://p5js.org/learn/coordinate-system-and-shapes.html. This is also a nice example as they can edit the code in browser and see what happens.

*	Take them through point(), line(), rect(), ellipse(). Just do one command at a time and get them to play around which changing the position and size of the shapes, and seeing what happens.
*	Then if time triangle() https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/triangle and quad() https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/quad
*	They are limited to these shapes for creating their simple interactive visual and its change in states.
*	You have shown them colour next color already, but run through that again, how to set the fill and the stroke of the shapes.

#### part 2 - coming up with a simple interactive idea (image that can change)
*	They should now come up with a concept for their visual and how it will change. And sketch it down on paper, or in a graphics program.
*	Remind them again about the co-ordinate system.
* Remind them as well, that the idea they come up with in class, should be expanded on and developed over the mid-semester break

### part 3
1. While they are working on their ideas, get them to hold them up to the screen and give feedback on the ideas.
2. For the computer labs we asked them to bring in their  sketch on paper or in a graphics program of their visual form and how it changes.
3. Get them to start to code the interaction. Show them through the base files again so they know where everything goes.
4. You can then spend the rest of class helping them to code their forms
5. Remind them that they will be submitting this as part of their final task and for folio 2 at the end of the semester. so keep in a safe place
6. Remind them they need to make an "image that can change" interactive as part of their "reflective practice" brief.

### keep it simple, their image can be abstract and simple, but conceptually make sense as when it is activated through the interaction.
