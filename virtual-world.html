    <h2 id="getting-to-know-spoke">2. Getting to know Spoke</h2>

    <p><strong>We use the world building tool called spoke to build our virtual
    world</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>go to <a target="_blank"  href=
      "https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke/projects/tutorial">https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke/projects/tutorial</a>
      and work through the world building tutorial. This will give you the basics of
      working in Spoke to build a small virtual world.</li>

      <li>Spend a little bit of time exploring the tool and also the assets available to
      you. in particular the <strong>architecture kit</strong> the <strong>rock
      kit</strong>, <strong>google poly</strong> and the <strong>hubs Sound
      Pack</strong></li>

      <li>For the moment you are just getting a feel for the <strong>material
      qualities</strong> of working in a 3d virtual environment.</li>

      <li>You can also drag images in, which can become elements of your world. This is
      good if you are wanting to add text (.png file with text on a transparent background
      for example)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="build-your-world">3. Build your world</h2>

    <p><strong>now comes the time to really think about your virtual environment and how
    you will build it from the world you created for your zine</strong></p>

    <h3 id=
    "please-ensure-you-log-into-hubs-before-proceeding-this-will-ensure-you-dont-lose-your-work.-your-login-will-work-for-both-hubs-and-spoke.">
    please ensure you log into hubs before proceeding, this will ensure you don&rsquo;t
    lose your work. Your login will work for both Hubs and Spoke.</h3>

    <p>You need to think about your world in three dimensions, your audience will be
    experiencing it from a &ldquo;first-person&rdquo; perspective, so they will never be
    able to see it all at once as you can in the Spoke editor.</p>

    <p>Think about the journey you take them on, and how you can reveal aspects of the
    world to them as they moved through it.</p>

    <p>Now very quickly run through the following steps. Remember small, self contained
    worlds, with a logic you derive from your zine world is what we are after
    here&hellip;</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li>make a little sketched map of the world you want to create. Draw this from top
      down, or if you are feeling really inspired in isometric projection. See: <a target="_blank"  href=
      "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=isometric+map+drawing&amp;atb=v235-1&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">
      https://duckduckgo.com/?q=isometric+map+drawing&amp;atb=v235-1&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images</a>
      for inspiration.</li>

      <li>Draw a line(s) on the map to represent your user journey through the small world.
      What elements will you introduce to invite/force the user to take this journey?</li>


      <li>Open <a target="_blank"  href=
      "https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke/">https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke/</a> and create a
      new project.</li>

      <li>Use the <strong>architecture kit</strong> the <strong>rock kit</strong>,
      <strong>google poly</strong> and the <strong>hubs Sound Pack</strong> to build your
      world.</li>

      <li>SAVE OFTEN and test it in hubs by following the following procedure:

        <ol type="1">
          <li>click <code style=
          "font-family: monospace; font-size: 18px; color: DarkMagenta;">publish
          to hubs</code> (top right of window)</li>

          <li>name your project (only if this is the first time you are doing this)</li>

          <li>click <code style=
          "font-family: monospace; font-size: 18px; color: DarkMagenta;">save
          project</code> button</li>

          <li>click <code style=
          "font-family: monospace; font-size: 18px; color: DarkMagenta;">save and
          publish</code> button</li>

          <li>click <code style=
          "font-family: monospace; font-size: 18px; color: DarkMagenta;">publish
          scene</code> button (might take a few moments to upload)</li>

          <li>click <code style=
          "font-family: monospace; font-size: 18px; color: DarkMagenta;">view
          your scene</code> button</li>

          <li>click <code style=
          "font-family: monospace; font-size: 18px; color: DarkMagenta;">create a
          room with this scene</code> button and open your scene in hubs.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>Continue to iterate your world until you are ready to share it.</li>
			<li>Rememeber sound is "spatial" in hubs, use a little bit wisely in your world. See <a href="https://freesound.org/">Freesound</a>, if you want to find more samples for your project</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="share-your-world">4. share your world</h2>

    <ol type="1">
      <li>You need to open your world as a room in Hubs to share it.</li>

      <li>Once you share it, take note of the URL for your new room. This is a unique URL
      and if several people go to it, you will all be in the one virtual environment.</li>

      <li>You also need to include this in your final website and folio.</li>
    </ol>
		<h2>5. Resources & Inspiration</h2>
		<h3>Luminous Rock World</h3>
		<div class="left-example">
			<p>This is a small world Andrew made, based on the "Luminous Rock World" demo zine from the world building/zine workshop. It only uses a few assets - rocks from rock kit and clouds from poly, plus a red light and 3 audio files i imported. You can open it in Spoke and check out how it's made and also look at it in Hubs as a room. Also note the "sky box" has been changed to make the sky darker. Use lights sparingly as these take a bit of computer power to render. Lights can be found in the "elements" section of the assets</p>

		<div class="left-example">
			<p>This is a sped up screen cast of the first part of making the Luminous Rock World in Spoke. This only shows part of the design journey, but you will see from the video that this is an iterative design process, and that it takes several iterations to get on the right path, that will eventually lead to the outcome shown above.</p>

		<h3>Desiderium</h3>
		<p>Hayley Zheng's Desiderium is a wonderful example of a series of complex virtual worlds created using Poly assets. It is created in the Unity game engine and has a complex underlying narrative and an interactive user journey--Something to aspire to in your future endevours designing virtual environments.</p>
